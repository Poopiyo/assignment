            <h4>Reading</h4>
            <p>My favourite book is,<b>A man of the people</b></p>
            My favourite quote from the book,
            <q>
        He who knows not but knows not that he knows not is a fool.
        </q>
            <cite>chief Nanga</cite>
        </p>
        <p>Lets talk briefly about the book.</p>
        <p>
            As Minister for Culture, former school teacher M. A. Nanga is a man of the people, as cynical as he is charming, and a roguish opportunist. When Odili, an idealistic young teacher, visits his former instructor at the ministry, the division between them
            is vast.But in the eat-and-let-eat atmosphere, Odili’s idealism soon collides with his lusts—and the two men’s personal and political tauntings threaten to send their country into chaos. When Odili launches a vicious campaign against his former
            mentor for the same seat in an election, their mutual animosity drives the country to revolution.

        <h4>Photography.</h4>
        <p>Photography is not just about taking pictures</p>
        </p>



        <img src="images/forest.jpeg" alt="Forest picture" />
        </p>
        <p>The goal of fine-art photography is to express an idea, a message, or an emotion. This stands in contrast to representational photography, such as photojournalism, which provides a documentary visual account of specific subjects and events, literally
            representing objective reality rather than the subjective intent of the photographer; and commercial photography, the primary focus of which is to advertise products, or services.</p>
        <h5>Here is a list of places to take nice pictures.</h5>

        <ul>
            <li>Forests</li>
            <li>Waterfalls</li>
            <li>Hills and Mountains</li>
            <li>Rivers and oceans</li>
        </ul>
