    <h4>A man of the people.</h4>
    Lets start with my favourite quote,
    <q>
        He who knows not but knows not that he knows not is a fool.
        </q>
    <cite>chief Nanga</cite>
</p>
<p>Lets talk briefly about the book.</p>
<div3>
    <p>
        As Minister for Culture, former school teacher M. A. Nanga is a man of the people, as cynical as he is charming, and a roguish opportunist. When Odili, an idealistic young teacher, visits his former instructor at the ministry, the division between them
        is vast.But in the eat-and-let-eat atmosphere, Odili’s idealism soon collides with his lusts—and the two men’s personal and political tauntings threaten to send their country into chaos. When Odili launches a vicious campaign against his former
        mentor for the same seat in an election, their mutual animosity drives the country to revolution.

<h4>Photography is not just about taking pictures</h4>
</p>
<p>The goal of fine-art photography is to express an idea, a message, or an emotion. This stands in contrast to representational photography, such as photojournalism, which provides a documentary visual account of specific subjects and events, literally
    representing objective reality rather than the subjective intent of the photographer; and commercial photography, the primary focus of which is to advertise products, or services.</p>
<h5>Here is a list of cool places to take nice pictures.</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Forests</li>
    <li>Waterfalls</li>
    <li>Hills and Mountains</li>
    <li>Rivers and oceans</li>
</ul>
