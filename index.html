        <h4>A man of the people.</h4>
        Lets start with my favourite quote from the book,
        <q>
        He who knows not but knows not that he knows not is a fool.
        </q>
        <cite>chief Nanga</cite>
    </p>
    <p>Lets talk briefly about the book.</p>
    <div3>
        <p>
            As Minister for Culture, former school teacher M. A. Nanga is a man of the people, as cynical as he is charming, and a roguish opportunist. When Odili, an idealistic young teacher, visits his former instructor at the ministry, the division between them
            is vast.But in the eat-and-let-eat atmosphere, Odili’s idealism soon collides with his lusts—and the two men’s personal and political tauntings threaten to send their country into chaos. When Odili launches a vicious campaign against his former
            mentor for the same seat in an election, their mutual animosity drives the country to revolution.

    <h4>Photography is not just about taking pictures</h4>
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>The goal of fine-art photography is to express an idea, a message, or an emotion. This stands in contrast to representational photography, such as photojournalism, which provides a documentary visual account of specific subjects and events, literally
        representing objective reality rather than the subjective intent of the photographer; and commercial photography, the primary focus of which is to advertise products, or services.</p>
    <h5>Here is a list of cool places to take nice pictures.</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Forests</li>
        <li>Waterfalls</li>
        <li>Hills and Mountains</li>
        <li>Rivers and oceans</li>
    </ul>
